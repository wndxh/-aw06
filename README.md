Please finish the following tasks:

- Download no less than two categories of these metadata.
- Referring the example code in this repo, convert each line in the downloaded files into a POJO of `Product` class and save the object in a database like MySQL. 
- Integrate the database containing Amazon products with your own AW04 project and build an Amazon WebPOS system.


And, of course, always try to make the system run as fast as possible.
